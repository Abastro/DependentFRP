1. Dependent Types and Space/Time

Dependent types are given by types which depends on context. That is,

C, x : A |- y : B  then  C |- (\x. y) : PI (x : A. B)

for dependent product.

But if the variable x cannot separately exist (like space and time), it is impossible to directly put it in the context.

Thus, we introduce a pair which represents certain position (of space or time) and value, and use it instead of each variable.

Let's call it `Pt t a`. Now, context can be represented as

C, p : Pt t A |- v : V

For a trivial case of V being constant, this leads to

C |- (\p. v) : Pt t A -> V
